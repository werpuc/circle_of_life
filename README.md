# circle_of_life 

Earlier this year I've decided to quit my job and dedicate my time to self-education. I've imagined it as a regular job: learning hours 9-17 and social life afterwards. I've omitted just one (but crucial) obstacle - I just can't get up in the morning if I don't have to be somewhere else. This was the moment my dream was ruined.

Anyway, I gathered the data (what else can be done?) and in this project I try to find out if I can [blame it on the boogie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqxVMLVe62U) or just accept the fact and move on.
